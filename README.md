##MNIST Digit Classification
Project Overview
This repository contains two implementations of MNIST digit classification:

A basic neural network (Fully Connected Network).
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Both approaches aim to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset, showcasing the difference in performance and structure between a simple dense network and a CNN.

üìä Dataset Used
MNIST Dataset

A dataset of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels).
Split into:
Training set: 60,000 images.
Test set: 10,000 images.
Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit (0-9).

üìùImplementations
1. Fully Connected Network 
Input images are flattened into 1D arrays.
A simple architecture with:
One hidden dense layer (128 units, ReLU activation).
Output layer with 10 units (softmax activation).
Optimized using Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
2. Convolutional Neural Network
Input images are processed in their original 2D shape.
A more complex architecture with:
Convolutional and pooling layers to extract spatial features.
Dense layers for classification.
Results in significantly improved accuracy compared to the basic model.

Challenges Faced
Handling overfitting in the Fully Connected Network.
Ensuring sufficient computational resources for training the CNN.

üèÜ Key Takeaways
CNNs outperform basic dense networks for image data due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies.
The choice of model architecture depends on the complexity of the dataset and problem requirements.

‚ú® Future Enhancements
Experiment with data augmentation to improve generalization.
Explore more advanced architectures like ResNet or MobileNet.
Incorporate techniques like batch normalization and dropout for further optimization.
